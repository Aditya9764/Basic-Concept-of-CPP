//You can see in the above program that the variable count is declared static.
//So, its value is carried through the function calls.
//The variable count is not getting initialized every time the function is called. 


//Static variables in a class
//	As the variables declared as static are initialized only once as they are allocated space in separate static storage so, the static variables in a class are shared by the objects.
//	There can not be multiple copies of the same static variables for different objects.
//	 Also because of this reason static variables can not be initialized using constructors.
